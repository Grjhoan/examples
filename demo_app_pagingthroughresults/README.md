# Test Result Set Paging

This is an example app. It makes a Zendesk API call and pages through all results, pulling out specific values from the result array and creating a new array.

Results are output to the browser's console window.

**Optional setup:**

Edit assets/iframe.html and change the three lines commented with 'MODIFY'. These lines reflect the API call and subsequent results being retrieved.
